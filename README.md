# VS Code Quick Projects extension

This is the README for your extension "sixtwo-quickprojects". After writing up a brief description, we recommend including the following sections.

This is a plugin to quickly open a subfolder of one of your favourite directories (say `~/Documents` or `~/code`) as a new project.
There are similar extensions like <https://github.com/kurt67/vscode-projects>, but it seems overly complicated with stuff like caching, etc.
My goal with this extension is to have an very simple extension (one single JavaScript file, no TypeScript, etc) that is easy to customize.


## Extension Settings

Include if your extension adds any VS Code settings through the `contributes.configuration` extension point.

For example:

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `myExtension.enable`: Enable/disable this extension.
* `myExtension.thing`: Set to `blah` to do something.
